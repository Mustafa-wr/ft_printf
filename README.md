# ft_printf
ft_printf is a programming project at 42 that involves implementing a custom version of the printf function in C. The goal of the project is to create a function that takes a format string and a variable number of arguments and produces formatted output to the console or a file.

The ft_printf project requires you to implement advanced string manipulation, formatting, and output functionalities, including variable argument handling, parsing and formatting of special characters, and precision handling. It is a relatively long project that tests your understanding of advanced programming concepts, such as memory management, data structures, and string manipulation in C.

The ft_printf project provides a valuable opportunity to practice implementing complex algorithms and data structures in C, and to gain experience in solving real-world programming challenges related to string formatting and output handling.
